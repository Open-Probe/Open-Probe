# OpenProbe - Advanced Agent-Based Search System

OpenProbe is an opensource agent-based search system that performs deep web searches to answer complex questions. You can use any form of LLM model inference to use this system. It uses a LangGraph-based agent orchestrator, web UI made with Next.js, and a comprehensive evaluation framework.

## ✨ Features

- **Deep Web Search**: Multi-step search process with automated planning and execution.
- **Adaptive Replanning**: Revises search strategies when initial plans fall short.
- **Reflection**: Explains why previous plans failed and how they were improved.
- **Intelligent Reranking**: Jina-powered result reranking with optional local reranker support.
- **Query Rewriting**: Rephrases tool inputs into better search queries.
- **Code Execution Tool**: Executes Python code in a local REPL to compute answers.
- **Multi-Model Support**: Natively supports Google Gemini and any OpenAI-compatible models via providers like Lambda.
- **Evaluation Framework**: Built-in system for testing search quality.

### Core Components

- **Frontend**: A Next.js-based web interface in `frontend/`.
- **Backend**: A FastAPI server providing a REST API and WebSocket connection in `backend/`.
- **Search Engine**: The main agent orchestration system in `src/deepsearch/graph.py`.
- **Web Search**: Search functionality in `src/deepsearch/web_search/`.
- **State Management**: Agent state management in `src/deepsearch/state.py`.
- **Evaluation System**: Testing framework in `evals/`.

### LangGraph Workflow

The system uses LangGraph to orchestrate the search process:

1.  **Master Node**: Routes to other nodes based on the current state.
2.  **Plan Node**: Generates a structured research plan.
3.  **Search Node**: Executes web searches and summarizes findings.
4.  **Code Node**: Generates and executes Python code for computation.
5.  **Solve Node**: Synthesizes intermediate results into a final answer.
6.  **Replan Node**: Reflects on failures and generates a new plan.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js and npm
- API keys for:
  - Google Gemini API or an OpenAI-compatible API key (e.g., for Lambda).
  - Serper.dev API (for web search)
  - Jina API (for reranking, if not using a local reranker)

### Setup Steps

1.  **Clone Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Open-Probe/Open-Probe.git
    cd Open-Probe
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    # This single command installs all Python dependencies
    pip install -e .
    ```
    *Note: This project uses `uv` for faster dependency management, but `pip` is fully supported.*

3.  **Set Up API Keys**

    Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:
    ```env
    # Sonic credential — either a Personal Access Token from the Sonic
    # Self-Service Auth Manager or an 
    # Entra OAuth/JWT access token. The PAT is for testing only; production
    # traffic requires the JWT.
    SONIC_JWT=your_token

    # Serper.dev API key for web search
    WEB_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_api_key

    # Jina API key for reranking
    JINA_API_KEY=your_api_key

    # Optional: override the Sonic models (defaults shown)
    SONIC_PLAN_MODEL=claude-opus-5
    SONIC_COMMON_MODEL=claude-sonnet-5
    SONIC_CODE_MODEL=claude-sonnet-5
    ```

## 🚀 Running OpenProbe

To run the services manually:

1.  **Start the Backend**
    ```bash
    python backend/start_server.py
    ```

2.  **Start the Frontend**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    # Install dependencies (only on first run)
    npm install
    # Run the UI
    npm run dev
    ```
Access the UI at **http://localhost:3000**.

### Using the CLI

The CLI provides direct access to the DeepSearch agent.

```bash
# The package should already be installed from the setup steps

# Run a search
python -m src.deepsearch.cli search "How many meters taller is the Burj Khalifa compared to the Empire State Building?"

# Run with more replanning attempts
python -m src.deepsearch.cli search --max-replan 2 "What year was the first Uber employee born?"

# Run in interactive mode
python -m src.deepsearch.cli search --interactive
```
